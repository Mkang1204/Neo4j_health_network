Good afternoon everyonr! I'm Marjorie Kang. For those who did't meet me before. I'm a research technologist from Pulmonary division and I'm working on the Data Management and Bioinformatics Core for the SCRIPT study. 
so why I am working on the wiki instead of the administritive Core. The reason is simple - we don't have before and I am constantly talking with differnent groups and 
should know the aims of each Core better.v 1. very little communication 2. stimulate creative 3. 

originally I tried to use Google drive and google docs but it doesn't have a good version control function so I just moved on to GitHub!
