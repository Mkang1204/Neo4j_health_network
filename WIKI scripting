Good afternoon everyonr! I'm Marjorie Kang. For those who did't meet me before. I'm a research technologist from Pulmonary division and I'm working on the 
Data Management and Bioinformatics Core for the SCRIPT study. 
so why I am working on the wiki instead of the administritive Core. The reason is simple - we don't have before and I am constantly talking with differnent groups and 
should know the aims of each Core better.v 1. very little communication 2. stimulate creative 3. GitHub Pages -> setup the website based on our repository

WHAT

HOW to 'get my work registered'

demo + links + will share in the Slack channel  

Three keywords 

WHY WHAT and HOW
so the benefits of keeping a wiki is obvious
1. 
it can make the collaboration with groups more efficiently. 
Imagine that one year after our project took off, we still have the question of who is generating the genomics data, or what is Marjorie doing for the DMBI Core 
And afraid to ask. so just come to the wiki and click the corresponding link (but of course, I'm sure that we won't have this kind of question any more 
with everyone get involved with the study wiki)

2. Version control
originally I tried to use Google drive and google docs but it doesn't have a good version control function so I just moved on to GitHub! 

3. Tutorial
it can be a turtorial for our new members in the study or other interested researchers. 
This may greatly benefit further large group studies

What & how
Let me guide you through a tour of the study wiki
1. Home page - upcoming meetings
2. pages - High level view and study summary
3. side bars - handy links to our on premise resources
4. at the bottom is the link to the grant description from a website
5.
