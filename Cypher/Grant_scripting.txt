The whole dataset is 389 providers and 1610 pairs (collaboration number). It was filtered by 25/125 shared encounters from the original dataset 
with 1002 providers and 34700+ pairs. The score of pairs are changed into integers and loaded as weight, and the single providers are loaded into Gephi as nodes.
The layout of the nodes and edges in the figure were implemented by a 3-step-process. First, we applied the Force Atlas layout. It is a force-detected algorithm
that considers edge weights to determine the strength of a relationship between 2 connected nodes. Then we applied the Fruchterman Reingold layout. It is an algorithm

Three places to be confirmed
1. the numbers occurred in the paragraph especially the whole dataset
2. whether to include the detailed description of the 2 algorithms
