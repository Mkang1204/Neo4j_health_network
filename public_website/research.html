<ul>
 	<li><strong>Project 1 </strong>will deploy robust tools for flow sorting macrophage and lymphocyte subset populations, isolating RNA from these populations, and performing transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis to compare successful and unsuccessful host responses to infection.</li>
 	<li><strong>Project 2 </strong>will focus on two main areas: 1) the bacterial genomic profiles and 2) the microbiome changes and communities (including bacteria, bacteriophage, other viruses, and fungi)Â associated with unsuccessful outcomes in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia.</li>
 	<li><strong>Technology Core </strong>will perform cell sorting of NBBAL macrophage and lymphocyte subsets, RNA sequencing, and whole genome methylation, and perform parallel studies in a unique humanized alveolar macrophage mouse model.</li>
 	<li><strong>Data Management and Bioinformatics Core</strong> will develop tools to enrich large comprehensive datasets, from clinical phenomics to host-pathogen genomics by managing the collection and storage, providing input to the Modeling Core, and increasing the accessibility of study results.</li>
 	<li><strong>Modeling Core </strong>will then use innovative modeling approaches including a model of the alveolus during pneumonia as an ecosystem out of balance combined with unique machine learning tools and neural networks to generate biomarkers of host, pathogen and/or microbiome patterns predictive of successful pneumonia outcome. Predictive</li>
 	<li>biomarkers developed in the Modeling Core will then be validated in a prospective confirmatory cohort of patients in whom analogous data will be generated.</li>
 	<li><strong>Administrative Core </strong>will perform the outward-facing role of education and outreach to the community and sponsor, as well as regularly exchanging datasets, analytic tools, and specimens with NIH-sponsored/approved repository sites.</li>
</ul>
