2.Did you come across a challenge/issue in either a work or school project? And, how did you handle it?  


3.Have you had previous client service experience?  

4. What is your five year plan?  


I have you
scheduled to meet with me at 1-2pm and then with two project managers (Bryce
and Mark) and two cse's (Mike and Charles).

 I’d like to meet with you for an hour to get to know you and let you know the details about our culture.  Then I’d have you meet a project manager and a few client service engineers so you can ask them detailed questions about the role and anything else you’d like to ask about.  You’d also introduce yourself so that you can determine if this is a good fit for you.
