Thank you for taking the time out of your workday to speak with me this afternoon. I enjoyed learning more about what life is like as an Application Engineer at Mathworks and left our conversation with a heightened enthusiasm for empowering more Engineers and Scientists with my relevant skills and experience.

Besides the part of my academic and working experience I shared with you today, I believe my experience in configuring Azure resources for the data pipeline is another strong support in integrating Mathworks products with Cloud services. Also, my data visualization skills can also help with the demo for customers. After all, 'A picture is worth a thousand words'. In a nutshell, I am feeling more and more certain that this role is a perfect fit for me I cannot wait to apply my various engineering knowledge and skills to empower Mathworks' clients!

Thank you again for providing me with the opportunity to interview for this high-impact role at Mathworks. I will stay warm and look forward to hearing from you.
